# We Care

This project is a **responsive landing page** for a pet shop, created as part of my learning journey in web development.
The original **desktop-only layout** was written during a lecture, and the objective of this project was to adapt it
into a design that works on both **mobile** and **desktop** screens, applying the concepts of responsive design.
